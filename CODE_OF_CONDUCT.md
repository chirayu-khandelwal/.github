# TCET Open Source Community Guidelines

As members of TCET Open Source, we are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone who wishes to contribute to our Organization. We recognize and celebrate the creativity and collaboration of contributors and the diversity of skills, experiences, cultures, andopinions they bring to the projects and communities they participate in.

We value diverse opinions, but we value respectful behavior more. The following Code of Conduct explains your expected behavior within the Organization. These guidelines are made to ensure everyone can express themselves and their skills & capabilities within the Organization, but not at the expense of anyone else.

We expect all members to abide by the following Code of Conduct to ensure that their project and their team are great representatives of the Organization to everyone.

## General Guidelines

1. New users can contribute each day. Some are well-established developers, while others are just beginning. **Be welcoming** and open to other ideas and experience levels. Make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started.
2. Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may happen. But remember to **criticize ideas, not people**. Share thoughtful, constructive criticism and be courteous to those you interact with. If you’re unable to engage respectfully, consider taking a step back.
3. TCET Open Source is an Organization with people from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. Try to put yourself in others’ shoes and understand their feelings before you address them. Do your best to help keep **the Organization where others feel safe** to make contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.

## Resolve peacefully

We do not believe that all conflict is necessarily bad; healthy debate and disagreements often yields positive results. However, it is never okay to bedisrespectful.
If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute.
If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.

## Communications
We use [GitHub](https://github.com/tcet-opensource) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/r7ZhAREg2M) only for all communications. All contributors should have both applications on all their working devices. Conversations regarding the specific repositories should be discussed on GitHub. Other formal conversations will take place on Discord.

## Reporting problems

As an Organization, we boast having a well-defined structure and hierarchy to address to conflicts of interest. Each project is maintained by a specific **Project Team**, who are the first point of contact for contributions and information. They can be reached out for such problems. We also have **Human Resources** who will receive and handle reports of code of conduct violations. At an escalation point, you can report problems directly to the **Office Bearers** by emailing at opensource@tcetmumbai.in.

We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response. We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from the Organization and org-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of thereport and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without notice.
